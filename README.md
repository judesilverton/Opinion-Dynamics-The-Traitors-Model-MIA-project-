PLEASE READ BEFORE READING/RUNNING CODE:

If you plan to run the code, create a folder "Opinion dynamics" in your documents. In addition, the code in the files for Figure 4 through to Figure 11 can take from an hour to 4 hours to run each. If you would like to run these still but not be waiting around, change "iters" to a lower number; preferrably less than or equal to 50.

How the code corresponds to the report:

1. Chapter 1 Graphs.R - Figures 2 and 3 in Chapter 1

2.
