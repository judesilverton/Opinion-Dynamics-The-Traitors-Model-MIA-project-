PLEASE READ BEFORE READING/RUNNING CODE:

- If you plan to run the code, create a folder "Opinion dynamics" in your documents. In addition, the code in the files for Figure 4 through to Figure 11 can take from an hour to 4 hours to run each. If you would like to run these still but not be waiting around, change "iters" to a lower number; preferrably less than or equal to 50. Graphs may well be different, but this may help to give an idea of what the code does.

- "Chapter 1 Graphs.R" contains the code corresponding to Figures 2 and 3 in Chapter 1. 
For all remaining R scripts, they are named by the appropriate Figure in Chapter 4 that they produce.
